Description: 
This is the home page of the Diabetic Patients' Re-admission Prediction in-class competition opened for Big Data Course in UIT, Vietnam. In this competition, you're supposed to create a Kaggle Notebook (written in Python and PySpark) to predict the readmission of diabetic patients.
Each team can submit the solution up to 10 times each day.
-
Rules: It's compulsory to submit your solution using Kaggle Notebook output file (i.e. all results from summitting separated .csv solution files are invalid).
Use PySpark for loading data and classification model.
You're supposed to share your Notebook later for checking.
Each team has maximum 4 members.
Just name your team to "TeamX" where X is your team number. DO NOT try to use ridiculous names.
Provide information about your team (team number, list of members) in the Notebook.
